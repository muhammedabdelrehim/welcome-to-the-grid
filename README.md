# Welcome to the grid...

This is a repository for Q42 which contains a grid.

The Grid component is a full standalone App.

The assignment took me about a total of 24 to 30 hours. It's incomplete as I got stuck at the Fibonacci Series. I did make a start, but I don't know how to complete it.

I hope the code gives you a better insight on my coding capabilities.

Enjoy...

## **Setting up the project:**

### In Terminal:

> git clone git@github.com:muhammedabdelrehim/welcome-to-the-grid.git

> yarn install && yarn storybook
